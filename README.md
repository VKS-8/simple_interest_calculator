# VKS-8-Simple-Interest-Calculator
Cognizant IBM Course - Final Project


Create a simple interest calculator that does the following:

1. Meets form design requirements
2. Has three types of input: input field, range slider, option selection drop down
3. Has 'Compute Interest' button to submit inputs
4. Form should show error message if principal input does not meet validation requirements; 
   both native browser and custom alert which closes after user clicks the 'OK' button
5. Form should focus on principal input field after user closes custom alert error message;
   form should not submit until this field meets validation
6. When the 'Compute Interest' button is clicked after meeting validation requirements, 
   the form should display the results with the user's inputs, 
   interest earned based on user inputs, and year this interested earned is realized
7. The form should reset to the original on-page-load design
8. Focus should be on principal input field after reset

My deviations from requirements:

1.  Changed background color of principal input field to light red with red border while invalid;
    added a "required  " placeholder to focus user on entering a valid value
